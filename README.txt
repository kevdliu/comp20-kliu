1) What is the purpose of this Git repository?
This repository contains assignments and projects created by Kevin Liu for the 
Tufts Comp 20 Web Design course. It contains three individual assignments:
Landmarks- a Google Maps based web app that displays surrounding students and landmarks, 
my_old_kentucky_home- A web app that displays a music video and its lyrics in real-time, 
and responsive- A web app that displays different portions of an image depending on 
browser window size. 

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was assignment 3: creating the server portion of the landmarks
application. It allowed me to explore various tools and libraries including Heroku, 
Node/ExpressJS, and Mongodb. It was also interesting to learn about processing and 
handling requests from clients to peek into the workings of a server. 

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have definitely learned a lot during this course, including writing scripts in Javascript, 
setting up and running a web server using Heroku, storing data on the server side using
Mongodb and client side using cookies and local storage, among other useful web technologies. 

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I learned about the importance of security in web applications. From the demonstration of 
Cross-site Scripting in class which completely defaced an innocent website and setup a redirect to
another website, I realized that many steps must be taken to defend against the various methods
of attacks. I also learned that when developing applications, it is often times not neccessary or
even detrimental to reinvent the wheel. Utilizing libraries and solutions already created by other
people can significantly reduce development time and improve performance and security. 

5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I would like to learn more about web security and how to properly protect my web applications
from malicious attacks from hackers. In addition, I would also like to look more into web performance
to learn how to create applications that perform at its peak in all kinds of conditions.
